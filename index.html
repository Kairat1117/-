	<h2>Khabib to Conor:It is the same thing</h2>
	<p>It's the same thing as the previous fight. If it's a first round finish, I'd back Conor. From the
second and further, then Dustin wins.
The Russian - who retired in March with a record of 29-0 with eight knockouts - has
submission victories over both McGregor and Poirier, so he knows a thing or two about
their game plans and skill sets.
He memorably scaled the Octagon at UFC 229 after defeating McGregor to attack his
cornerman Dillon Danis, who had reportedly shouted insults at Khabib following the fight.
The Russian has turned to promoting following his retirement and is mentoring fellow
lightweight Islam Makhachev - currently ranked #9 in the UFC rankings.</p>
